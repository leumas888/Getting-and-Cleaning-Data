# Code Book

### Overview

This code book describes the variables, data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

### Data collection

The raw data was obtained from the link as follow: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### Raw data description

Each record includes the following information:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

See Readme file into 'UCI HAR Dataset' for more information.

### Data transformation

The data was subsequently transformed as follow:

-  Training and  test sets were merged to create one data set.
-  Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-  Replaced data set names with descriptive activity 
-  Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
-  From the data set in step 4, created a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Tidy data description

The tidy data set contains:

-  Subject: subject identifier. Its range is from 1 to 30.
-  Activity: activity label, covering WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
-  Value: mean of all measurement collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signal

Naming conventions are as follow:

-  measurement: variable names include the relevant test (i.e., Accelerator, Gyroscope, Magnitude). Time and frequency of activities are measured.
-  mean()/std(): mean or standard deviation of the measurement
-  -X/Y/Z: one direction of a 3-axial signal


The data set is written to the file 'sensor_avg_by_subject.txt'.
